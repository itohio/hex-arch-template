# Interfaces and relevant types

Here we define interfaces and types for adapters that drive the application and
interfaces that allow the application to drive adapters.

- The interfaces and types defined in `left.go` should be used by adapters such as API, UI, etc handlers.
- The interfaces and types defined in `right.go` should be used to drive such things as databases, storages, external APIs, etc.
